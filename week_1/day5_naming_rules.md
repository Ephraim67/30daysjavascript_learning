## Rules for Naming variables
The rules we must follow when naming variables in JavaScript are as follows:
* Names can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the _ (underscore) and $ (dollar sign) characters; nothing else.
  Hence, first-name is invalid since it contains a hyphen (-) which is illegal to put in a variable name.
* Names can't begin with a digit. Hence, 2nd is invalid.
* Names can't contain spaces.  Hence, first word is invalid.
* Names can't be reserved keywords. Hence, var is invalid.

## Tips for naming variables
* Be descriptive
* Don't be overly descriptive
* Abbreviate long words
* Use a casing convention to break words
