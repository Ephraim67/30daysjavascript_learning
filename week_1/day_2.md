## Alert:
* Displays a popup dialog box with a message.
* Used for interacting directly with the user (e.g., showing notifications or alerts).
* Halts code execution until the user acknowledges the dialog by clicking "OK".


## console.log
* Outputs information to the browser's console (developer tools).
* Used mainly for debugging or logging information during development.
* Does not interfere with the user's experience or halt code execution.

## Common Use Cases
* **alert**:
* Notify the user about something critical (e.g., unsaved changes or errors).
* Rarely used in production environments as it disrupts the user's experience.

## console.log
* **console.log**
* Debugging and tracking the flow of the program.
* Checking variable values or outputs during development.
* Testing API responses, loops, or functions.

## Statements
Statements are the instructions that the JavaScript engine executes. They can perform actions like assigning values, declaring variables, calling functions, or making decisions.
**Statement Types:**
* Declaration Statements: Declare variables, constants, or functions.
* Control Flow Statements: Control the execution flow of the program.
* Expression Statements: Evaluate and return a value.

## Semicolons
Semicolons (;) are used to terminate statements. While JavaScript allows you to omit semicolons in many cases (due to automatic semicolon insertion, or ASI), it's a best practice to use them explicitly for clarity and to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Comments
Comments are used to explain code, making it more readable and maintainable. JavaScript supports two types of comments:
* Single-Line Comments
Use // for single-line comments
* Multi-Line Comments
Use /* ... */ for multi-line comments
